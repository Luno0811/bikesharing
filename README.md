# bikesharing

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data for bikesharing broken down by timeframe as well as by gender. Results were looked at by hour as well as over an average weekday.

Analysis

There are a number of data visualtions we would like to analyze as part of this study.

To start with, trip durations were broken down in a couple different wats. As far as duration just by itself, most trips were very short, most no longer than 10-15 minutes. This speaks to most users using them for a work commute, somthing not for sightseeing but more as a public tranportation alternative. When broken down by gende, these checkouts were overwhelmingly male, suggesting business people trying to get to and from the office.

This is backed up by our next set of visualizaions broken down by weekday and hour, showing a large number of trips happening Monday-Friday at typical morning and evening commute times, around 8 am and after 5 pm, again mainly male. This reinforces our idea that these are mostly used as commuting alternatives.

As a finishing stroke to our idea about the most common use, the start and end locations hsow may users starting from mainly residential/apartment areas and dropping off near businesses.

All these results are shown here.
